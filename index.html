            <p>One big problem in STEM is the idea tha  t women don´t do sciences, don´t do engineering and definitely don´t change the world, because it´s completely wrong, the history has taught us one time after another that women are liders, women are intelligent, smart and brilliant, capable of dicovering the big next thing, giving the proof of that imposible theorem or building the next revolutionary docking system.

                <span class="cardName">Mae Jeminson</span>

She talks fluently russian, japanesse, swahili and also english. Since little, she became interested in archeology and astronomy. At the age of 16 she attended Stanford University and graduated in chemical engineering. Later on, she got a doctoral degree in medicine from the Cornell University.

Hypatia was a greek speaker daughter of Theon of Alexandria who develop a famous student´s version of Euclid´s Elements. Among her work we can found a mathematical model that predicted the movement of planets(epicycles), great apportations to algebra and commentaries in Conic Sections articles. She was cruelty murdered.

And the second for the discovery of polinium and radium. In 1910 she produced radium as pure metal, proving the existence of a new element. Radioactive compounds are important in medicine and in multiple scientific areas.
